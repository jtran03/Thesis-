1) Document position experiment (now) ((0,0) travel to 1.5,1.5)  
   - Normal Plots 
   - Mathematics 
   - Simulink Blocks (Formatted and Readable) 
1.5) Document position experiments (0,0 travel to 10,10) 
   - Normal Plots
   - Mathematics 
   - Simulink Blocks (Formatted and Readable) 
   - Repeat this 3x  
   - Run experiment in a loop (streamlined) 
2) Multiple waypoints A->B->C->D (arrange into a figure 8) 
   - 6 way points 
   - Run clockwise and counter clockwise 
   - Normal Plots
   - Mathematics 
   - Simulink Blocks (Formatted and Readable) 
3) Document pose experiment (0,0 travel to 10,10 at a certain orientation) 
   - Normal Plots
   - Mathematics 
   - Simulink Blocks (Formatted and Readable) 
4) Obstacle detection and avoidance 
   - detect and avoid siutation
   - detect but cannot avoid situation
